# vf:Transfer

 Moving rights to and responsibilities for an economic resource from one agent to another. This does not cover change of location. The exact rights and responsibilities can be defined by an agreement between the agents, which accompanies the resource to be transferred. If not, the rights are assumed to be rights to consume, use, or transfer the resource.
